# Simple Notes 📝
<hr>

This is a simple note taking web-based app. This was built for fulfiling the final project requirements for [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). This app has the following features: 

- Registration and authentication: New users 👩🏽‍💻can register themselves. Featues are accessible only after logging in
- Home page lists all notes created by the logged-in user sorted by last update timestamp ⏰. The user can choose to edit or delete a note ❌
- New notes 🖋 can be created with a title and body text 
- Notes can be searched 🔍 based on string matching on either title or body text

This app was built using the following tech stack:
- `flask` for building the backend
- `sqlite3` for storing information about registered users and notes 
- `bootstrap` was to enhance the frontend elements and build a responsive design

#### Potential future enhancements: 
- Ability to add tags for each note 🏷
- Grouping notes into hierarchical groups
